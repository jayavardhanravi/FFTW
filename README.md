# FFTW
DTFT and Convolution using FFTW library and C++ programming

This project shows how we can perform the discrete time fourier transform
and convolution using FFTW library and C++ programming language. By
sampling the signal given we have converted the input signal in the time
domain to the discrete.We have performed the discrete time fourier trans-
form by using the inbuild libraray functions. The outputs obtained by the
convolution using FFTW are compared with the outputs obtained from the
pure C++ programming to check the validity and accuracy. The compared
data is stored to text files and graphs are plotted to compare.
